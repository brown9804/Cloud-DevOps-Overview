> What is GitHub Pages? <br/>
> GitHub Pages is a `free service that turns your GitHub repositories into websites`. You can host HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and it’s perfect for static websites that `don’t require server-side processing`. GitHub Pages supports custom domains, making it easy to create a professional-looking website.

## How is GitHub Pages Used?
- **Personal Websites**: Showcase your portfolio, resume, or blog.
- **Project Documentation**: Host documentation for your open-source projects.
- **Organization Sites**: Create websites for organizations or communities.
- **Demo Sites**: Share live demos of your projects.

## Automate the process of converting Markdown to static HTML and deploying it using GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions

1. Create a GitHub Repository
      - Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Name it `username.github.io`, where `username` is your GitHub username.
      - Make sure the repository is public.
2. Add Your Markdown Files
      - Clone the repository to your local machine.
      - Add your Markdown files to the repository.
      - Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
3. Create a GitHub Actions Workflow
      - In your repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory.
      - Inside this directory, create a file named `md-html-deploy.yml`.
4. Define the Workflow: Add the following content to the `md-html-deploy.yml` file to set up a workflow that converts Markdown to HTML and deploys it to the `main` branch:
      1. **Checkout Repository**: This step checks out your repository so that the workflow can access the files.
      2. **Set up Node.js**: This step sets up Node.js, which is required for some Markdown converters.
      3. **Install Dependencies**: This step installs the necessary dependencies for your project.
      4. **Convert Markdown to HTML**: This step uses `pandoc` to convert Markdown files to HTML and places them in the `_site` directory.
      5. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: This step commits the generated HTML files back to the `main` branch and pushes the changes. This ensures that your GitHub Pages site is updated with the latest HTML files.

    > Static HTML refers to web pages that are delivered to the user's browser exactly as stored, without any server-side processing. Static sites are fast, secure, and easy to deploy, making them ideal for simple websites, portfolios, blogs, and documentation.
3. Push Your Code: Commit and push your code to the main branch. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run and deploy your site to GitHub Pages.
