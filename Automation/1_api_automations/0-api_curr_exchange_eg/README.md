REST (**Representational State Transfer**) is an architecture that is based on web standards. It defines a **set of constraints and protocols** which need to be followed **while creating web services**. <br/>

- It follows the **HTTP protocol** and considers every **component as a resource**. These components can be accessed with the help of **HTTP standard methods**. <br/>
- REST architecture includes the **REST server and client**.
    - REST **server** provides **access to the resources**. 
    - REST **clients** **modify** the **resources** on the REST **server**.
- The **unique address** of the **resource** can be located with the help of **URI (Uniform Resource Locator)**.  REST represents the **resource** in various **representations such as JSON, XML, text**.

REST is not a specification but a set of guidelines on how to architect a network-connected software system. <br/>
A REST web service is any web service that adheres to REST architecture constraints. <br/>
These web services expose their data to the outside world through an API. REST APIs provide access to web service data through public web URLs.
